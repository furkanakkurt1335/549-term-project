This folder includes the files for BALIBASE alignment benchmarks. Sequences folder includes the sequences in each benchmark set in fasta format. Reference alignments can be found in [PEbA paper](https://github.com/mgtools/PEbA/tree/master/data). To evaluate alignment quality, sum of pairs score w.r.t. reference alignments should be calculated for BLOSUM, PAM and our matrix.
